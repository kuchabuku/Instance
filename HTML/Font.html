      Contrast that with Cainiao, in which Alibaba has a controlling stake.
      将京东物流与阿里巴巴控股的菜鸟相比较。 It does not own many of the
      logistics assets in its network. 菜鸟网络没有很多物流资产。 Instead it
      allows around 3,000 logistics companies employing some 3m couriers to plug
      into its platform.
      相反，它允许约3000家物流公司雇佣的大约300万名快递员入驻其平台。 Its aim is
      to integrate and streamline the vast delivery resources that already exist
      across China, rather than build its own.
      其目标是整合和精简中国现有的大量配送资源，而不是建立自己的配送资源。 The
      company has teamed up with most large logistics services—and taken
      investments from them as well.
      菜鸟与大多数大型物流服务公司合作，并从中获得投资。 Alibaba, for its part,
      has bought minority stakes in several large operators as a means of
      exerting more influence over the industry.
      阿里巴巴则购买了几家大型物流公司的少数股权，以此来对中国物流业施加更多影响。
